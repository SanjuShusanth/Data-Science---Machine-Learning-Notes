    "2. **Hierarical Clustering** are not based on cetroids, it will consider each data points as a cluster. Finding the nearest point and creates a new cluster, this process will continue until it forms a single cluster. There are two most important approaches Agglomerative and Divisive clustering. Hierarichal clustering is used when dataset is small. It is applicable for variety of data.\n",

    "3. **DB Scan Clustering** contains one core point and one border point and one outlier point. a minimum number of data points are clustered together withon the particular radius. They can learn more hard patterns that are present in the dataset. It is robust to outliers and better than both Kmeans ans Hierarical Clustering.  "
